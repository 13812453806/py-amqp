About
=====

This is a fork of amqplib_ which was originally written by Barry Pederson.
It is maintained by the Celery_ project, and used by `kombu`_ as a pure python
alternative when `librabbitmq`_ is not available.

This library should be API compatible with `librabbitmq`_.

Differences from `amqplib`_
===========================

- Supports draining events from multiple channels (``Connection.drain_events``)
- Support for timeouts
- Support for heartbeats

    - ``Connection.heartbeat_tick(rate=2)`` must called at regular intervals
      (half of the heartbeat value if rate is 2).
    - Or some other scheme by using ``Connection.send_heartbeat``.
- Supports RabbitMQ extensions:
    - Consumer Cancel Notifications
        - by default a cancel results in ``ChannelError`` being raised
        - but not if a ``on_cancel`` callback is passed to ``basic_consume``.
    - Publisher confirms
- Support for ``basic_return``
- Uses AMQP 0-9-1 instead of 0-8.
    - ``Channel.access_request`` and ``ticket`` arguments to methods
      **removed**.
    - Supports the ``arguments`` argument to ``basic_consume``.
- Exceptions renamed to have idiomatic names:
    - ``AMQPException`` -> ``AMQPError``
    - ``AMQPConnectionException`` -> ConnectionError``
    - ``AMQPChannelException`` -> ChannelError``
- Adds ``Connection.is_alive`` that tries to detect
  whether the connection can still be used.
- Adds ``Connection.connection_errors`` and ``.channel_errors``,
  a list of recoverable errors.
- Exposes the underlying socket as ``Connection.sock``.
- Adds ``Channel.no_ack_consumers`` to keep track of consumer tags
  that set the no_ack flag.
- Slightly better at error recovery
